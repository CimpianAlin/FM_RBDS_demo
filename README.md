# REDHAWK Basic Waveforms - FM RBDS Demo
 
## Description

Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK FM RBDS Demo Waveform. This waveform processes the RBDS digitial message present in broadcast FM radio signals. This waveform tune and filters out this signal, performs a BPSK demodulation, then decodes the RBDS data.

## Build/Installation Instructions
This is a wavform project and thus does not need to be built just installed into the $SDRROOT/dom/waveforms directory. One way to do that is to open the project in the REDHAWK IDE and drag it into the Target SDR Folder.
